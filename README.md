# Sr.Microhap

This is the repository holding the explanations of the theory behind
on R package we will develop that we will call "Se√±or Microhap" in 
long form, but is written `Sr.Microhap` and stands
for **S**hort **r**ead **Microhap**lotyping.

The goal of the software is to call very short haplotypes that
occur only upon short reads, i.e. from amplicon sequencing
or from RAPTURE or similar technologies.
